# __Reminder List__
This application was made as a test task to consolidate knowledge about Retrofit library. 
The essence of the application: there is a list of client appointment reminders,
in which you can add client appointment reminders. Clients are randomly generated using [this API service](https://randomuser.me/). 
You can set the name of the reminder, the date of the appointment, and a specific appointment time. 
One hour before the appointment time with a specific client you receive a notification in the form of an appointment reminder.
