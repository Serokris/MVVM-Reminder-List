# __Reminder List__

This application was made as a test task to consolidate knowledge about Retrofit library. The
essence of the application: there is a list of client appointment reminders, in which you can add
client appointment reminders. Clients are randomly generated
using [this API service](https://randomuser.me/). You can set the name of the reminder, the date of
the appointment, and a specific appointment time. One hour before the appointment time with a
specific client you receive a notification in the form of an appointment reminder.
